It is particularly prevalent in various patient populations, including children, surgical patients, and those with chronic illnesses such as cancer and respiratory diseases like EPOC and cystic fibrosis. \n\nIn children, desnutrición necessitates additional caloric intake for recovery and often requires interventions such as nutritional support, enteral, or parenteral nutrition. The condition arises when a child's nutritional needs are not met, leading to potential complications. In adults, desnutrición can occur due to various medical conditions, including the effects of cancer treatments, and is a critical concern for patients with head and neck tumors, who may struggle with feeding and experience weight loss.\n\nDesnutrición is also a significant issue in critical care settings, affecting patients with high metabolic and catabolic demands, such as burn victims. The condition can worsen the prognosis of patients by exacerbating the effects of drug-nutrient interactions and complicating existing health issues. \n\nThe Government of Spain recognizes malnutrition as a significant health concern and is actively working to address it through specific strategies and regulations.
