In cancer patients, sarcopenia can negatively impact physical capacity and nutritional status, and it is often worsened by treatments like neoadjuvant chemotherapy. \n\nAdditionally, sarcopenia is associated with malnutrition, particularly in patients with liver disease, and is a primary feature of cancer cachexia, a syndrome marked by anabolic resistance that impedes the incorporation of amino acids into muscle.
