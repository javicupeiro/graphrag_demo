It is particularly prevalent among elderly patients with dysphagia, who may struggle to consume sufficient nutrients. In patients with liver disease, such as those suffering from cirrhosis, malnutrition refers to the deficiency of essential nutrients, which can lead to serious complications. Additionally, malnutrition is a critical issue in patients with EPOC (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), where it adversely affects overall health and increases the risk of mortality. Furthermore, malnutrition poses particular risks to children, as it can lead to various health issues stemming from dietary imbalances. Overall, malnutrition is a multifaceted condition that impacts diverse populations, necessitating targeted interventions to address its various forms and consequences.\",16\r\n1065,CIRRHOSIS,\"Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism.\",3\r\n28,DEHYDRATION,Dehydration is a condition that often accompanies malnutrition and can lead to serious health complications in elderly patients.,3\r\n1069,NUTRITION IN END STAGE LIVER DISEASE,Nutrition in end-stage liver disease focuses on dietary management to improve outcomes for patients with severe liver dysfunction.,1\r\n1070,NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS,\"Nutritional interventions are strategies designed to enhance the nutritional status of individuals, particularly in clinical settings.
