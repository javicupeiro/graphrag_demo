It is particularly important in the management of diabetes, where it is administered to help control hyperglycemia. In critically ill patients, Insulina is recommended for glycemic control, aiding in the management of their overall health. The hormone is also beneficial for burn patients, as it supports protein synthesis and enhances glucose uptake in muscles and the liver. Additionally, Insulina's function is influenced by the presence of arginine, which can affect its regulatory capabilities. Overall, Insulina is essential for maintaining metabolic balance and is a key component in the treatment of various conditions related to glucose metabolism.\",11\r\n621,OXANDROLONA,\"Oxandrolona is a synthetic derivative of testosterone, classified as an anabolic steroid. It is utilized in the treatment of critically ill patients and can be combined with growth hormone (GH) to enhance height in individuals with poor growth potential. Additionally, oxandrolona is known for its ability to increase lean body mass and accelerate wound healing, particularly in severe burn patients.\",3\r\n2046,BETABLOQUEANTES,\"Betabloqueantes, including propranolol and metoprolol, are a class of medications utilized in the treatment of critical patients, particularly burn patients.

Its secretion can be enhanced by the amino acid arginine. GH is utilized in medical treatments, particularly in burn care, where it helps to decrease healing time and associated costs. However, its application in adults remains a topic of debate due to concerns regarding hyperglycemia.
