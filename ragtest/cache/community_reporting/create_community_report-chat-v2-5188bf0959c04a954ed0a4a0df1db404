This method is primarily utilized for patients who are unable to consume food orally or absorb nutrients through their digestive system, such as those with chronic intestinal failure, severe malnutrition, or conditions that render the gastrointestinal tract non-functional.\n\nParenteral nutrition is indicated in various clinical scenarios, including cases of intestinal obstruction, complete gastrointestinal failure, and in patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. It is particularly vital for pediatric patients with specific dietary needs or those at risk of malnutrition due to digestive issues. The treatment is administered through a central venous access, ensuring that essential nutrients, including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals, are delivered effectively.\n\nWhile parenteral nutrition can be life-saving and is essential for maintaining nutritional status in patients who cannot eat, it is also associated with potential complications, such as infections, metabolic disturbances, and gastrointestinal issues. Therefore, it is generally recommended as a last resort when enteral feeding is not feasible or sufficient. In oncology settings, parenteral nutrition may be used to support patients with advanced cancer and malnutrition, although its benefits can vary.\n\nOverall, NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL serves as a critical nutritional support method for individuals unable to meet their dietary needs through traditional means, ensuring they receive the necessary nutrients to maintain health and prevent complications associated with malnutrition.\",250\r\n2283,ESPEN GUIDELINES,\"The ESPEN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of recommendations established by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, focusing on enteral nutrition.

This institution provides comprehensive services related to parenteral nutrition, highlighting its commitment to advancing this area of medical care.\",258\r\n598,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,VITAMINAS,\"NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL, which refers to the intravenous administration of nutrients, is a critical component of patient care, particularly for those unable to consume food orally. Within this context, VITAMINAS play a vital role, as they are essential nutrients that must be included from the onset of parenteral nutrition. The administration of vitamins is crucial to prevent deficiencies that can arise in patients receiving nutritional support. Therefore, it is imperative to monitor vitamin levels in these patients to ensure their health and well-being.\",258\r\n709,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,VITAMINA K,La nutrición parenteral incluye la administración de vitamina K como parte de la terapia nutricional,258\r\n734,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,NAD,NAD includes parenteral nutrition as a method of nutritional support,258\r\n496,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL PERIFÉRICA,\"NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL, specifically NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL PERIFÉRICA, refers to a method of administering nutrition directly into the bloodstream through peripheral veins. This approach is utilized primarily for short-term nutritional support. However, it is important to note that peripheral parenteral nutrition is considered a less effective form of parenteral nutrition when compared to central parenteral nutrition.\",257\r\n510,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,NUTRICIONES PARENTERALES ADULTOS PROTOCOLIZADAS EN EL HOSPITAL,Parenteral nutrition is the main focus of the hospital's protocol for adult patients,257\r\n518,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,SÍNDROME DE REALIMENTACIÓN,\"NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL, or parenteral nutrition, is a medical intervention used to provide essential nutrients to patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrition through oral intake. However, it carries the risk of developing Síndrome de Realimentación, or refeeding syndrome, particularly in patients who are malnourished. This syndrome is a serious complication that can arise when transitioning patients back to nutrition after a period of starvation or inadequate intake. It is crucial to manage parenteral nutrition carefully to mitigate the risk of refeeding syndrome, as improper administration can lead to significant health issues in vulnerable patients. Therefore, healthcare providers must be vigilant when initiating feeding in patients who have been on nutrición parenteral to prevent this potential complication.\",257\r\n529,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,ÁCIDOS GRASOS OMEGA-3,Omega-3 fatty acids are included in parenteral nutrition for their anti-inflammatory effects in critical patients.,257\r\n541,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,FÍSTULA PANCREÁTICA,\"NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL refers to the method of providing nutritional support intravenously, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. In the context of FÍSTULA PANCREÁTICA, which is an abnormal connection that forms between the pancreas and other structures, the effectiveness of nutritional support through parenteral means has been evaluated. It has been observed that parenteral nutrition is less effective in promoting the closure of pancreatic fistulas when compared to enteral nutrition. However, it may still play a role in the conservative management of pancreatic fistulas, suggesting that while it is not the preferred method for closure, it can be utilized as part of a broader management strategy.\",257\r\n563,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,COSTE-EFECTIVIDAD,\"NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL and COSTE-EFECTIVIDAD are closely related concepts in the context of nutritional support. Cost-effectiveness plays a crucial role in determining the use of parenteral nutrition, particularly due to its significant economic implications. Parenteral nutrition is typically more expensive than enteral nutrition, which directly affects its cost-effectiveness. Therefore, when considering nutritional options, the higher costs associated with parenteral nutrition must be weighed against its benefits to assess its overall value in patient care.\",257\r\n587,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,PACIENTE CRÍTICO,Parenteral nutrition is essential for critical patients who cannot receive nutrition orally,257\r\n616,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,CIRROSIS,Cirrhosis can develop as a severe complication in patients who have been on prolonged parenteral nutrition.,257\r\n728,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,GRUPOS RELACIONADOS CON EL DIAGNÓSTICO,La nutrición parenteral es un procedimiento que puede influir en la clasificación de pacientes en los GRD debido a su impacto en la complejidad de los casos.,257\r\n547,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,SUPORTE NUTRICIONAL,La nutrición parenteral es una forma de soporte nutricional utilizada en pacientes que no pueden alimentarse por vía digestiva,256\r\n559,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,PANCREATITIS AGUDA GRAVE,Parenteral nutrition may be used when enteral feeding is insufficient for patients with severe acute pancreatitis.,256\r\n573,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,GRUPO AULA MÉDICA,\"Grupo Aula Médica collaborates in the field of medical education, including topics on parenteral nutrition\",256\r\n605,NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL,HIPERGLUCEMIA,\"NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL and HIPERGLUCEMIA are interconnected, as hyperglycemia is a potential complication that can arise from improper management of parenteral nutrition.
