It is a classic symptom of celiac disease, where patients experience liquid evacuations frequently. Diarrhea can also arise as a common complication in patients receiving nutritional support, significantly impacting their overall health and recovery. This condition may result from various factors, including interactions between medications and enteral nutrition, as well as infections.\n\nIn patients undergoing radiotherapy, diarrhea is a prevalent side effect that can be managed with probiotics. Additionally, it is often associated with carbohydrate malabsorption, which leads to osmotic overload and impaired absorption of water and sodium. Diarrhea can negatively influence the nutritional intake and status of patients, particularly those with cancer, contributing to malnutrition.\n\nIn the context of enteral nutrition, diarrhea is characterized by an increase in the frequency and volume of bowel movements, which can lead to hydroelectrolytic imbalances and nutrient malabsorption. Furthermore, in transplant patients, diarrhea can cause intestinal nitrogen losses, adversely affecting their nitrogen balance. Overall, diarrhea is a multifaceted condition that can arise from various underlying issues and has significant implications for patient health and nutrition.\",19\r\n1021,PROBIÓTICOS,\"Probiotics are supplements that play a significant role in influencing gut microbiota and fermentation processes, which can potentially affect carbohydrate absorption and digestion.
