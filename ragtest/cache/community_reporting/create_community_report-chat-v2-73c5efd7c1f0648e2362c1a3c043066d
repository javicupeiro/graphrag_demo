It is particularly prevalent among elderly patients with dysphagia, who may struggle to consume sufficient nutrients. In patients with liver disease, such as those suffering from cirrhosis, malnutrition refers to the deficiency of essential nutrients, which can lead to serious complications. Additionally, malnutrition is a critical issue in patients with EPOC (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), where it adversely affects overall health and increases the risk of mortality. Furthermore, malnutrition poses particular risks to children, as it can lead to various health issues stemming from dietary imbalances. Overall, malnutrition is a multifaceted condition that impacts diverse populations, necessitating targeted interventions to address its various forms and consequences.\",16\r\n4738,CHILDREN,\"Children are individuals in the developmental stage from birth to adolescence.
