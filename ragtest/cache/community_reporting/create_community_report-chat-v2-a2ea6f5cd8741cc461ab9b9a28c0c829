It is a vital component of hemoglobin and myoglobin, which are crucial for oxygen transport and energy metabolism, making it especially important for athletes. Iron is also necessary for blood health, and dietary recommendations for its intake vary across different age groups to prevent deficiency, particularly in early childhood.\n\nIn terms of supplementation, iron is often administered in parenteral nutrition, although its addition can be controversial. It is important to note that iron should be taken on an empty stomach to enhance absorption, and it is absorbed in its ferrous state. However, it can interfere with the absorption of certain medications, which necessitates careful monitoring and independent addition in prolonged nutritional regimens. Overall, iron is a vital nutrient that requires attention to ensure adequate levels for optimal health.\",17\r\n1053,SELENIO,\"SELENIO, or selenium, is a trace mineral that plays a critical role in various bodily functions, including reproduction, thyroid function, DNA synthesis, immune function, and thyroid hormone metabolism.
