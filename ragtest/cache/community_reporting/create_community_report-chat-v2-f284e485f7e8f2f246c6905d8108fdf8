It is particularly important for the plasticity of synapses in the hippocampus and acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin A is essential for maintaining overall health, and its deficiency can pose risks, especially in specific populations such as children, premature infants, and older adults.\n\nIn commercial preparations for children, Vitamin A may be insufficient, necessitating careful monitoring in patients receiving nutritional support. For pediatric patients on parenteral nutrition, Vitamin A is administered in specific doses to ensure adequate intake. Additionally, individuals with conditions like Cystic Fibrosis may require supplementation of Vitamin A to support their health and prevent deficiencies.\n\nOverall, Vitamin A is found in animal products and certain vegetables, and its supplementation is often discussed in the context of health risks and benefits, highlighting its importance in maintaining optimal health across different age groups and health conditions.\",12\r\n383,DIETA IDEAL PARA LOS MAYORES,\"The Ideal Diet for Seniors is a dietary guideline specifically designed to enhance nutrition and health for older adults.
