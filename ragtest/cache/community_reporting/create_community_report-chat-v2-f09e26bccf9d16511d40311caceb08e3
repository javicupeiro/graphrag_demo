This condition can arise from various factors, including nutritional deficiencies. Hypomagnesemia is associated with an increased risk of mortality, particularly in critically ill patients.\",3\r\n793,PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,\"Physical activity is a crucial component of health, recommended for daily practice to maintain fitness and overall well-being. It encompasses any movement that expends energy, making it essential not only for general health but also for specific health management, such as diabetes. Engaging in regular physical activity can improve insulin sensitivity and contribute positively to the management of diabetes, highlighting its importance in promoting a healthier lifestyle.\",3\r\n998,HIPERURICEMIA,\"Hiperuricemia is a medical condition characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. This condition can occur in patients with Glycogen Storage Disease type III (GSDIII) and is associated with various health issues, including the potential development of gout. Elevated uric acid levels can lead to complications if not managed properly, highlighting the importance of monitoring and addressing this condition in affected individuals.\",11\r\n794,ALCOHOL,\"Alcohol is a substance that can significantly interact with various medications, leading to both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. It has the potential to modify the metabolism of numerous drugs, which can affect their efficacy and safety. Dietary guidelines address alcohol consumption, recommending moderation if it is consumed. However, alcohol consumption is particularly discouraged after bariatric surgery due to its potential adverse effects on metabolism and nutrient absorption. Additionally, alcohol can decrease the absorption of magnesium in the body. It is also advised to avoid alcohol for at least 12 hours prior to medical tests to ensure accurate results.\",15\r\n278,FRUCTOSA,\"Fructosa, also known as fructose, is a simple sugar and a monosaccharide commonly found in fruits. It plays a significant role in nutrition and health, particularly in the context of children's diets. While fructose can enhance the palatability of pediatric formulas, it is important to limit its intake in children's diets to promote better health outcomes. Excessive consumption of fructose can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, especially when it is not absorbed properly, which may occur in individuals with fructose malabsorption. Additionally, fructose can alter uric acid excretion and is implicated in the development of hyperuricemia, a condition characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. Overall, while fructose has its uses in enteral nutrition and can be beneficial in moderation, caution is advised regarding its consumption, particularly among children and individuals prone to malabsorption issues.\",6\r\n786,MEN,\"Men are individuals of the male gender, often referenced in dietary guidelines and health recommendations.\",3\r\n787,WOMEN,\"Women are individuals of the female gender, often referenced in dietary guidelines and health recommendations.\",3\r\n3442,ANTABUS,\"Antabuse, also known as disulfiram, is a medication used to support the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to ethanol.\",1\r\n3441,ALIMENTOS RICOS EN TIRAMINA,Foods high in tyramine can lead to hypertensive crises in patients on certain medications.,1\r\n3462,METRONIDAZOLE,\"Metronidazole is a medication that can inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase, affecting alcohol metabolism.\",1\r\n3463,PHENYTOIN,Phenytoin is a medication whose metabolism can be reduced by acute alcohol consumption.,1\r\n3464,ANTIDEPRESSANTS,Tricyclic antidepressants can have enhanced depressant effects on the central nervous system when combined with alcohol.,1\r\n3465,CLORAMPHENICOL,Chloramphenicol is a medication that can have its hepatotoxic effects potentiated by alcohol.,1\r\n3466,BETA-BLOCKERS,Beta-blockers can have their hypotensive effects enhanced by alcohol consumption.,1\r\n3467,AMPHETAMINES,Amphetamines can have their stimulating effects diminished by alcohol consumption.,1\r\n1388,CETOACIDOSIS DIABÉTICA,Cetoacidosis diabética can also contribute to elevated uric acid levels in the body.,1\r\n1386,DIETA HUMANA,\"La dieta humana influences the formation and excretion of uric acid, particularly through the intake of purine-rich foods.\",1\r\n1389,DIURÉTICOS TIAZÍDICOS,\"Diuréticos tiazídicos can decrease renal elimination of uric acid, leading to higher levels in the blood.\",1\r\n1384,GOTA,Gota is a clinical syndrome caused by an inflammatory response to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues due to high uric acid levels.,1\r\n1390,SALICILATOS,\"Salicilatos at low doses can also affect uric acid elimination, contributing to hyperuricemia.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n1211,NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT,HIPOMAGNESEMIA,Hypomagnesemia must be monitored in patients receiving nutritional support to ensure adequate magnesium levels.,93\r\n2241,PATIENT,PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,The patient is encouraged to engage in physical activity as part of their diabetes management plan,38\r\n2443,OBESIDAD,HIPERURICEMIA,\"Obesidad is linked to decreased uric acid elimination, increasing hyperuricemia risk\",33\r\n2679,GSDIII,HIPERURICEMIA,Hyperuricemia is a rare complication that can occur in GSDIII patients,32\r\n2356,ALCOHOL,HIPERURICEMIA,\"Alcohol consumption interferes with uric acid excretion, contributing to hyperuricemia\",26\r\n1292,FRUCTOSA,GLUCOSA,La fructosa y la glucosa son azúcares que pueden interactuar en el proceso de absorción intestinal,25\r\n2354,ALCOHOL,BARIATRIC SURGERY,Alcohol consumption is advised against after bariatric surgery due to its effects on recovery and nutrient absorption,22\r\n2357,ALCOHOL,EXAMENES DIAGNOSTICOS,Avoiding alcohol is necessary before diagnostic tests to ensure accurate results,19\r\n1265,FÓRMULAS PEDIÁTRICAS,FRUCTOSA,Fructose is added to pediatric formulas to enhance flavor and improve acceptance among infants,19\r\n2355,ALCOHOL,HIPOMAGNESEMIA,El alcohol puede causar hipomagnesemia al disminuir la absorción de magnesio,18\r\n2363,ALCOHOL,INSULIN,\"Alcohol can potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of insulin, leading to potential health risks.\",18\r\n2341,MEN,ALCOHOL,Alcohol consumption guidelines often specify different limits for men and women,18\r\n2343,WOMEN,ALCOHOL,Alcohol consumption guidelines often specify different limits for men and women,18\r\n1274,LACTOSA,FRUCTOSA,\"LACTOSA and FRUCTOSA are both sugars that can cause malabsorption in some individuals.
