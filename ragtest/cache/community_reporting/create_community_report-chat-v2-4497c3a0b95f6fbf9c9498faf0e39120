In children's diets, glucose should be consumed in moderation to maintain health.\n\nGlucose plays a significant role during physical activity, acting as a vital energy source, especially in prolonged exercises. It is also utilized in nutritional support, including parenteral nutrition formulas, where it is included as a macronutrient to ensure adequate energy supply.\n\nIn medical contexts, glucose is administered during the TTOG (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) to assess the body's glucose metabolism. However, its administration must be carefully controlled to avoid complications associated with hyperglycemia, as excessive glucose can affect sodium levels and interfere with the uptake of radiotracers during medical tests.\n\nOverall, glucose is a crucial carbohydrate that influences various physiological processes and dietary considerations, highlighting its importance in both health and medical nutrition.\",19\r\n3610,HÍGADO,\"The hígado, or liver, is a vital organ with multiple essential functions in the body.
