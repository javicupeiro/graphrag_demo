They are utilized in the treatment of several medical conditions, including hyperaldosteronism, where they help reduce aldosterone production. In oncology, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone are employed to improve appetite and alleviate nausea in cancer patients, although they are associated with a range of side effects.\n\nCorticosteroids are also important in the diagnosis and treatment of Cushing's disease, a condition characterized by excessive cortisol levels. Additionally, they serve as anti-inflammatory medications in managing complications following hematopoietic cell transplants and are used to treat graft-versus-host disease. In these contexts, corticoides can enhance the adverse effects of chemotherapy, including nausea and vomiting.\n\nFurthermore, corticosteroids can influence carbohydrate metabolism in transplant patients and are effective in reducing inflammation during allergic reactions. However, it is important to note that while they can mitigate symptoms, they do not provide a corrective treatment for the underlying conditions. Overall, corticoides are versatile medications with a wide range of applications in both inflammatory and hormonal disorders.\",9\r\n1817,ACETATO DE MEGESTROL,\"Acetato de Megestrol is an orexigenic medication primarily utilized to enhance caloric intake and promote weight gain in patients experiencing nutritional deficiencies.

However, it is important to note that while Acetato de Megestrol aids in weight gain, it does not contribute to an increase in lean mass or improve survival rates among these patients.\",4\r\n1818,CIPROHEPTADINA,\"Ciproheptadina is a potent antagonist of histamine and serotonin, recognized for its orexigenic properties.
