It acts as a powerful antioxidant, playing a crucial role in protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. This vitamin is vital for the growth and repair of tissues, contributing to skin health, immune function, and the maintenance of bones and connective tissue.\n\nIn addition to its antioxidant properties, VITAMINA C is important for the conversion of dopamine into noradrenaline, highlighting its role in neurotransmitter synthesis. It also enhances the absorption of iron from dietary sources by converting iron from its ferric (Fe3+) state to the more absorbable ferrous (Fe2+) state, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with iron deficiency.\n\nFor patients undergoing oncological treatment, VITAMINA C is recommended in specific amounts according to the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), although it is advised that intake should not exceed double these recommendations to avoid potential overdose.
