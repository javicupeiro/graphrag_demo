It plays a crucial role in brain and eye health, making it particularly important for neurodevelopment and visual function. DHA is also proposed for dietary supplementation in conditions such as cystic fibrosis, where it may help modulate inflammatory responses. Additionally, it has been shown to have beneficial effects in critically ill patients, similar to those of another omega-3 fatty acid, EPA. According to new European legislation enacted in 2020, DHA must be present in infant formulas, underscoring its significance in early development. Found naturally in fish oil, DHA is vital for maintaining overall health and has anti-inflammatory properties that contribute to its therapeutic potential.\",6\r\n4011,SMOFLIPID,\"SMOFlipid is a balanced lipid emulsion designed for parenteral nutrition, comprising 30% soybean oil, 30% coconut oil, 25% olive oil, and 15% fish oil.
