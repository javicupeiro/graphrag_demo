It is involved in the metabolic response to nutrient intake, helping to elevate blood sugar when necessary. Additionally, the secretion of glucagon can be stimulated by the amino acid arginine, further influencing its role in glucose metabolism.\",3\r\n777,INSULINA,\"Insulina is a crucial hormone that plays a significant role in regulating glucose levels in the blood. It is particularly important in the management of diabetes, where it is administered to help control hyperglycemia. In critically ill patients, Insulina is recommended for glycemic control, aiding in the management of their overall health. The hormone is also beneficial for burn patients, as it supports protein synthesis and enhances glucose uptake in muscles and the liver. Additionally, Insulina's function is influenced by the presence of arginine, which can affect its regulatory capabilities. Overall, Insulina is essential for maintaining metabolic balance and is a key component in the treatment of various conditions related to glucose metabolism.\",11\r\n2242,ARGININA,\"ARGININA, also known as arginine, is a dibasic amino acid that plays a crucial role in various metabolic pathways within the body. It is primarily synthesized in the kidneys and acts as a nitrogen transporter. Arginina is recognized for its significant contributions to recovery and nutrition, particularly for surgical patients and those undergoing oncology treatments. As an immunonutrient, it may enhance nutritional support and potentially reduce hospital stays for oncology patients.\n\nIn addition to its role in recovery from surgery and cancer treatments, arginina serves as a precursor to nitric oxide, which is vital for T lymphocyte function, thereby supporting immune responses. Furthermore, arginina is commonly included in nutritional formulas aimed at improving the health of patients in critical care situations. It is also utilized in dietary supplements to aid recovery after exercise and to optimize athletic performance. Overall, arginina is an important amino acid with diverse applications in health and nutrition.\",11\r\n621,OXANDROLONA,\"Oxandrolona is a synthetic derivative of testosterone, classified as an anabolic steroid. It is utilized in the treatment of critically ill patients and can be combined with growth hormone (GH) to enhance height in individuals with poor growth potential. Additionally, oxandrolona is known for its ability to increase lean body mass and accelerate wound healing, particularly in severe burn patients.\",3\r\n2046,BETABLOQUEANTES,\"Betabloqueantes, including propranolol and metoprolol, are a class of medications utilized in the treatment of critical patients, particularly burn patients.
