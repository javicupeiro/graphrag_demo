Diuretics promote the excretion of excess fluid, which can help correct sodium levels in patients suffering from hyponatremia. However, it is important to note that diuretics can also contribute to the development of hyponatremia, particularly if they are not managed properly. Specifically, thiazide diuretics are commonly associated with causing hyponatremia due to their significant impact on sodium levels. Therefore, while diuretics can be beneficial in treating hyponatremia, careful monitoring and management are essential to avoid exacerbating the condition.\",68\r\n3090,HIPONATREMIA,SÍNDROME DE SECRECIÓN INAPROPIADA DE ADH (SIADH),\"SIADH is a common cause of hiponatremia, leading to excessive water retention and dilution of serum sodium levels.\",68\r\n3107,HIPONATREMIA,UREA,Los niveles de urea en sangre son utilizados para ayudar a clasificar el tipo de hiponatremia que presenta un paciente.,68\r\n3132,HIPONATREMIA,CONIVAPTÁN,\"Conivaptán is also used to treat hiponatremia, functioning similarly to Tolvaptán\",68\r\n3135,HIPONATREMIA,ALGORITMO MULTIDISCIPLINAR,The multidisciplinary algorithm provides guidelines for the treatment of hyponatremia,68\r\n1769,NEFROPATÍA DIABÉTICA,HIPONATREMIA,Nefropatía diabética can lead to hyponatremia due to its impact on kidney function and electrolyte regulation,68\r\n3122,HIPONATREMIA,ACIDOSIS METABÓLICA,\"Acidosis metabólica can occur alongside hyponatremia, contributing to the overall electrolyte imbalance\",67\r\n3124,HIPONATREMIA,ALTA DE AGUA,\"Water intoxication can lead to hyponatremia, establishing a relationship between the two\",67\r\n3103,HIPONATREMIA,CAÍDAS,Patients with hyponatremia are at a higher risk of falls due to instability in gait.,67\r\n3112,HIPONATREMIA,CIRROSIS HEPATICA,\"Cirrhosis hepática can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites), which is associated with hiponatremia.\",67\r\n3102,HIPONATREMIA,CONSCIENCIA,Hyponatremia can result in decreased levels of consciousness due to its neurological effects.,67\r\n3125,HIPONATREMIA,DEFICIT DE SAL,\"Salt deficiency can contribute to the development of hyponatremia, indicating a relationship\",67\r\n3104,HIPONATREMIA,DETERIORO COGNITIVO,Chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive decline and deterioration in mental function.,67\r\n3087,HIPONATREMIA,DIAGNÓSTICO Y ETIOLOGÍA DE LA HIPONATREMIA,The diagnosis and etiology of hyponatremia are essential for identifying and managing the condition in patients receiving artificial nutrition.,67\r\n3093,HIPONATREMIA,DIARREAS,Diarrhea can exacerbate the risk of hyponatremia due to fluid and electrolyte loss.,67\r\n3118,HIPONATREMIA,DIURÉTICOS DEL GRUPO TIAZIDA,\"Diuréticos del grupo tiazida are a common cause of hiponatremia in patients, as they can lead to electrolyte imbalances\",67\r\n3101,HIPONATREMIA,EDEMA CEREBRAL,\"Hyponatremia, characterized by low sodium levels in the blood, can lead to cerebral edema, which is the swelling of the brain.
