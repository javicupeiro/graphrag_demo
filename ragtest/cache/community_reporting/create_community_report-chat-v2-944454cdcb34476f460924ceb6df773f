Micronutrients are particularly important for maintaining health and physical performance, especially during physical activity. \n\nIn patients receiving nutritional support, a deficiency in micronutrients can hinder weight gain, while an excess can occur in those receiving parenteral nutrition. These vitamins and minerals are vital for the nutritional management of various health conditions, including cancer. Overall, micronutrients encompass vitamins, minerals, and trace elements that are required in small amounts but are critical for supporting various bodily functions and promoting overall health.\",10\r\n386,HIDRATOS DE CARBONO,\"Hidratos de carbono, or carbohydrates, are essential nutrients that play a crucial role in providing energy for various bodily functions and activities.

A focus on complex carbohydrates and fiber is recommended for overall health benefits. Furthermore, carbohydrates are advised for intake up to two hours before surgery to help reduce discomfort and anxiety in patients.\n\nIn the context of specific health conditions, such as diabetes and galactosemia, the management of carbohydrate intake is critical. For individuals with diabetes, careful monitoring of carbohydrate consumption is necessary during exercise to maintain stable blood sugar levels. Additionally, hidratos de carbono are included in nutritional support for pediatric patients, highlighting their importance in early development.\n\nOverall, hidratos de carbono serve as a primary source of energy in dietary products and are essential for enhancing athletic performance, supporting children's growth, and managing specific health conditions.
