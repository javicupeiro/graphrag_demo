It is often discussed in relation to its benefits for patients in catabolic states, such as those recovering from surgery, trauma, or severe illness. \n\nAs a dietary supplement, glutamine is administered to support the nutritional needs of critically ill patients, including those with brain injuries, burn injuries, and those undergoing chemotherapy or transplantation. It is frequently supplemented in both enteral and parenteral nutrition to enhance immune function, promote gut health, and aid in recovery while reducing complications and infections. \n\nResearch has shown that glutamine levels decrease during severe illness, highlighting its importance in clinical settings. Its use is particularly recommended for patients in critical care, where it has demonstrated benefits in improving recovery outcomes and minimizing complications. Overall, glutamine is a vital nutrient that supports the health and recovery of patients in various medical contexts.\",11\r\n262,NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION,\"Nutritional supplementation involves providing additional nutrients to patients, either parenterally or enterally, to enhance their nutritional status and improve health outcomes. This practice is particularly beneficial for individuals with chronic conditions, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), where nutritional support can play a crucial role in managing health. Nutritional supplementation is also recommended to maintain nutritional balance during periods of prolonged dietary restrictions, such as before medical tests. Furthermore, it encompasses the use of dietary supplements to support patients undergoing treatments like chemotherapy, aiming to improve their overall health and recovery.\",7\r\n2870,ARGININE,\"Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid known for its immunomodulatory effects, particularly in stimulating T lymphocyte activity and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines.\",3\r\n263,NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS,\"Nutritional requirements encompass the specific dietary needs of individuals, particularly focusing on caloric and protein intake. These requirements are especially critical for surgical patients who may have heightened nutritional demands during recovery.
