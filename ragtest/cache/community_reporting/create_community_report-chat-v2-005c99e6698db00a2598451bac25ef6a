This concept encompasses various dimensions of health and is significantly influenced by factors such as nutritional support and medical treatment. In patients with chronic diseases, including EPOC (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and diabetes, quality of life is often assessed to understand the impact of their conditions and the effectiveness of interventions.\n\nFor cancer patients, quality of life can be severely affected by malnutrition and the side effects of treatments, highlighting the importance of nutritional management. Similarly, patients with short bowel syndrome experience a notable decline in their quality of life compared to the general population and other patient groups. The management of nutritional needs is also crucial for individuals with neurological diseases, where quality of life can be compromised.\n\nSuccessful interventions, such as bariatric surgery, have been shown to improve the quality of life for patients, demonstrating the relationship between health outcomes and life satisfaction. Additionally, quality of life is a key measure in cost-utility analyses, linking it to the effectiveness of health interventions.
