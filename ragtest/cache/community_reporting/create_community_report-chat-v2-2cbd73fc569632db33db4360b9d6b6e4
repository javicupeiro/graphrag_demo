They are essential in nutritional formulas to prevent deficiencies in patients, particularly in pediatric nutrition, where they are vital for energy and nutrient absorption. Lípidos serve as a concentrated energy source in the body, stored as triglycerides in adipose and muscle tissue, and are especially important during prolonged exercise, particularly for trained individuals.\n\nIn dietary guidelines, it is recommended that lipids constitute around 30% of total energy intake, with specific recommendations for the types of fats included. Lípidos are also incorporated into parenteral nutrition solutions to provide essential fatty acids and enhance caloric density. However, it is important to note that excessive infusion of lipids in patients receiving parenteral nutrition can lead to liver issues. Overall, lípidos are integral to maintaining health and energy levels, while also requiring careful management in clinical settings to avoid potential complications.\",8\r\n388,ÁCIDOS GRASOS SATURADOS,\"Saturated fatty acids are a type of fat found in animal products and certain vegetable oils, which should be consumed with caution.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n1599,LÍPIDOS,NUTRICIÓN PEDIÁTRICA,\"Lípidos play a crucial role in nutrición pediátrica by enhancing caloric intake and providing essential fatty acids necessary for growth and development.
