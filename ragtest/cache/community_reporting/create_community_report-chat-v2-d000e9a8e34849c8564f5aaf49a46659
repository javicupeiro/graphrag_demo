For instance, premature tube removal can occur due to increased laxity at the stoma site, which may require additional interventions to address. Similarly, gastrocolocutaneous fistulas can arise from improper implantation of the GEP, necessitating surgical correction. Understanding these complications is crucial for healthcare providers to mitigate risks and ensure patient safety.
