They play a significant role in medical treatments, particularly in the context of complications that may arise following hematopoietic cell transplants. However, their use is not without consequences; antibiotics can affect the microbiota and fermentation processes in the colon, which in turn impacts carbohydrate absorption and digestion. Additionally, the effectiveness and absorption of antibiotics can be influenced by food intake, and their administration can lead to changes in intestinal flora.
