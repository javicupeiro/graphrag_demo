It encompasses a group of diseases that can affect different parts of the body, including the head and neck, and has the potential to invade or spread to other areas. The disease often necessitates various treatments, such as bone marrow transplantation, and is the focus of numerous studies and clinical trials aimed at understanding its complexities and improving patient outcomes.\n\nCancer significantly impacts patients' nutritional needs, requiring specific dietary guidelines and nutritional support due to the effects of both the disease and its treatments on the patient's nutritional status. Research has indicated that certain nutritional interventions, including the use of arginine and glutamine, may enhance patient outcomes. Additionally, cancer is a prominent topic of investigation within research networks, such as the RETICS, which aim to improve prevention and treatment strategies for this challenging disease.\",26\r\n1611,GLUTAMINE,\"Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid that plays a critical role in various metabolic processes and is particularly significant in the context of nutritional support for patients experiencing critical illness and surgical recovery. It is often discussed in relation to its benefits for patients in catabolic states, such as those recovering from surgery, trauma, or severe illness. \n\nAs a dietary supplement, glutamine is administered to support the nutritional needs of critically ill patients, including those with brain injuries, burn injuries, and those undergoing chemotherapy or transplantation. It is frequently supplemented in both enteral and parenteral nutrition to enhance immune function, promote gut health, and aid in recovery while reducing complications and infections. \n\nResearch has shown that glutamine levels decrease during severe illness, highlighting its importance in clinical settings. Its use is particularly recommended for patients in critical care, where it has demonstrated benefits in improving recovery outcomes and minimizing complications. Overall, glutamine is a vital nutrient that supports the health and recovery of patients in various medical contexts.\",11\r\n262,NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION,\"Nutritional supplementation involves providing additional nutrients to patients, either parenterally or enterally, to enhance their nutritional status and improve health outcomes. This practice is particularly beneficial for individuals with chronic conditions, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), where nutritional support can play a crucial role in managing health. Nutritional supplementation is also recommended to maintain nutritional balance during periods of prolonged dietary restrictions, such as before medical tests. Furthermore, it encompasses the use of dietary supplements to support patients undergoing treatments like chemotherapy, aiming to improve their overall health and recovery.\",7\r\n1616,OMEGA-3,\"Omega-3 refers to a group of essential fatty acids, including DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), which are crucial for brain health. These fatty acids have been extensively studied for their positive effects on cognitive function and their potential role in mitigating dementia. Additionally, Omega-3 fatty acids are recognized for their benefits in critically ill patients, particularly when sourced from fish oil. Overall, Omega-3 plays a significant role in both neurological health and the recovery of patients in critical conditions.\",3\r\n1610,NP,\"NP, or Nutritional Parenteral, is a method of providing nutrition to patients intravenously when enteral feeding is not feasible. This approach is particularly important for critically ill patients, as it focuses on the administration of essential nutrients and the careful monitoring of their nutritional needs. Additionally, NP is relevant for patients who have undergone abdominal surgery, often due to digestive neoplasia, and who may face complications such as nausea and pain. Overall, NP serves as a vital nutritional support system for individuals unable to receive adequate nutrition through traditional means.\",8\r\n1419,MICRONUTRIENTS,\"Micronutrients are essential vitamins and minerals required in small amounts for proper health and play a critical role in various medical contexts. They are particularly important in nutritional support for critically ill patients, as their inclusion helps prevent deficiencies that can arise during periods of dietary restrictions, such as before medical tests. In cancer patients, micronutrients are often found to be deficient, which can adversely affect their overall health. Additionally, specific micronutrients like copper, selenium, and zinc are vital for immune modulation and wound healing, especially in patients who have suffered burns. Furthermore, micronutrients such as thiamine, folic acid, and zinc are crucial for metabolic processes, and their deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders in patients with conditions like pancreatitis. Overall, ensuring adequate intake of micronutrients is essential for maintaining health and supporting recovery in various patient populations.\",5\r\n445,VITAMIN D,\"Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining bone health and mineralization, particularly in infants and children. It is essential for the proper functioning of the muscular and skeletal systems and has been linked to cognitive function. Additionally, Vitamin D has been suggested to influence the immune system and may affect the risk of developing Type 1 Diabetes. It is also noted that cancer patients often experience deficiencies in Vitamin D, which can have significant implications for their health. Furthermore, deficiencies in this micronutrient have been associated with an increased risk of developing food allergies. Overall, Vitamin D is a vital nutrient with multiple health benefits and implications for various bodily functions.\",6\r\n2870,ARGININE,\"Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid known for its immunomodulatory effects, particularly in stimulating T lymphocyte activity and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines.\",3\r\n2836,ACETATE DE MEGESTROL,\"Acetate de Megestrol is a medication used to stimulate appetite in cancer patients, showing effectiveness in clinical trials.\",1\r\n2833,ANAMORELIN,\"Anamorelin is a ghrelin analog that has shown improvements in appetite, body weight, and lean mass in phase III studies, but is not yet available.\",1\r\n2830,ENOBOSARM,\"Enobosarm is a selective androgen receptor modulator currently in phase II studies, showing potential to increase lean mass and strength in patients.\",1\r\n2831,DRONABINOL,\"Dronabinol is a synthetic form of THC used in the U.S. as an appetite stimulant and antiemetic, affecting the endocannabinoid system.\",1\r\n2832,GRELIN,\"Ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates appetite, with clinical use limited due to its short half-life and need for parenteral administration.\",1\r\n2838,CORTICOIDS,,1\r\n2835,TESTOSTERONE DERIVATIVES,Testosterone derivatives are anabolic agents considered for therapeutic use in cancer patients to counteract muscle mass loss.,1\r\n2837,SUPLEMENTOS VITAMÍNICOS,\"Vitamin supplements are often used by cancer patients, though high doses may not provide benefits and could be harmful.\",1\r\n2864,OMEGA 3,Omega 3 refers to a type of fatty acid that has anti-inflammatory properties and may help in managing symptoms related to cancer cachexia.,1\r\n2889,YATES JW,Yates JW is a researcher who evaluated patients with advanced cancer using performance status.,1\r\n2890,CANCER CACHEXIA CLINIC,Cancer Cachexia Clinic is a specialized clinic focusing on weight loss in cancer patients.,1\r\n3165,ALLERGIES,\"Allergies are adverse reactions to certain foods that can affect 1-3% of the global population, with higher prevalence in children.\",6\r\n263,NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS,\"Nutritional requirements encompass the specific dietary needs of individuals, particularly focusing on caloric and protein intake.
