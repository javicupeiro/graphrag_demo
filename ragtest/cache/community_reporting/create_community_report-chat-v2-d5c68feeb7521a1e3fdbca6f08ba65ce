Factors influencing morbimortalidad include age, underlying pathology, and the quality of nutritional support provided to patients.\n\nIn surgical contexts, morbimortalidad is particularly relevant, as it reflects the rates of complications and mortality associated with different surgical techniques. Notably, endoscopic procedures tend to have lower rates of complications and mortality compared to traditional surgical methods.
