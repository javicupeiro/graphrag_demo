They are vital for recovery and muscle preservation, particularly in patients recovering from burns, cancer, or those with renal issues. Proteins are fundamental in clinical nutrition formulas, influencing solubility and stability based on factors such as pH and temperature. They are also critical in pediatric nutrition, providing necessary building blocks for growth and development.\n\nIn the context of physical activity, proteins are important for muscle synthesis and energy metabolism, making them essential for athletes. Their intake must be carefully managed, especially in specific populations like renal patients and those with diabetes, to ensure proper dietary management. Proteins vary in quality based on their source, with animal proteins generally offering higher biological quality compared to plant proteins.\n\nAdditionally, proteins must be consumed in adequate amounts for overall health and development, particularly in children, and can be sourced from various food items such as meat, fish, and legumes. It is important to note that proteins can be affected by thermal treatments, which may alter their quality and functionality, and they can interact with certain medications, impacting enteral nutrition.
