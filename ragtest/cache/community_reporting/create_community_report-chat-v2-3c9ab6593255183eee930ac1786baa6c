It is particularly prevalent among certain populations, including postmenopausal women and individuals on glucocorticoids. The condition is notably observed in patients with Turner syndrome, where it doubles the risk of fractures, and in those with Klinefelter syndrome, who are also at increased risk. Additionally, osteoporosis can develop in patients with celiac disease due to malnutrition, and it is associated with chronic respiratory diseases such as EPOC and cystic fibrosis. Chronic hyponatremia has also been linked to the condition. Furthermore, inadequate calcium intake is a contributing factor to osteoporosis, making it a concern for athletes as well.
