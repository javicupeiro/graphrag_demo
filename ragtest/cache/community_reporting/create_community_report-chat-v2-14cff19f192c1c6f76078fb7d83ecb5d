This condition poses a significant risk for patients with dysphagia, particularly following a stroke, as it can lead to pneumonia. Additionally, broncoaspiración is associated with enteral nutrition, where the risk of inhalation of digestive contents into the respiratory tract is heightened. It is particularly relevant for patients who may require nasoenteral tubes, as this method of feeding can increase the likelihood of aspiration. Overall, broncoaspiración is a critical concern in medical settings, especially for vulnerable populations.\",5\r\n54,DISFAGIA,\"Disfagia, also known as dysphagia, is a medical condition characterized by difficulty in swallowing. It is often associated with various health issues, particularly head and neck tumors, neurological disorders, and esophageal cancer. This condition can lead to significant nutritional risks, including malnutrition and aspiration, which can complicate the health of affected individuals. \n\nPatients with disfagia may require dietary modifications and specialized nutritional products to ensure adequate feeding. In some cases, enteral nutrition support may be necessary to meet their nutritional needs. The condition is particularly prevalent among patients with conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and those suffering from cerebrovascular diseases, where swallowing difficulties can exacerbate nutritional deficiencies.\n\nDisfagia is a cardinal symptom of esophageal cancer, often not presenting in the early stages of the disease, and it contributes to weight loss and alterations in food intake.
