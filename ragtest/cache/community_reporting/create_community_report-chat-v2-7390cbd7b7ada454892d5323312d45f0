These infants are particularly susceptible to glucose imbalances and may need elevated glucose intake to prevent hypoglycemia, which can occur due to their high energy expenditure. The nutritional requirements for these premature infants are typically measured in kilograms per day, highlighting the importance of careful monitoring and tailored nutritional strategies.

In critically ill patients, hyperglycemia can arise as a complication of parenteral nutrition. Additionally, it can be a concern for patients suffering from acute pancreatitis and for newborns, especially those with very low birth weight, if their glucose intake is not properly regulated. Furthermore, hyperglycemia may also develop in patients undergoing transplantation due to multiple factors, including the use of steroid treatments.
