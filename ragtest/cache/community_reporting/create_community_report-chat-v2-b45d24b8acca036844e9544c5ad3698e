Adequate nutritional status is linked to better recovery outcomes, making it a significant focus for healthcare providers. The relationships between nutritional support and the transplant procedure highlight the importance of addressing dietary needs to enhance patient recovery. [Data: Entities (2935), Relationships (1194, 1251, 4954)]\n\n## Infection prevention strategies\n\nInfection prevention is a critical aspect of care for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants, especially during the aplastic phase when the immune system is compromised. Effective infection control measures are essential to avoid complications that can arise from infections, which can be life-threatening for these patients. The relationship between infection prevention and the transplant process emphasizes the need for vigilant care during recovery.
