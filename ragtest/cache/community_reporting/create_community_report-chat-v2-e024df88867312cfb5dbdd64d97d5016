It is particularly prevalent in various patient populations, including children, surgical patients, and those with chronic illnesses such as cancer and respiratory diseases like EPOC and cystic fibrosis. \n\nIn children, desnutrición necessitates additional caloric intake for recovery and often requires interventions such as nutritional support, enteral, or parenteral nutrition. The condition arises when a child's nutritional needs are not met, leading to potential complications. In adults, desnutrición can occur due to various medical conditions, including the effects of cancer treatments, and is a critical concern for patients with head and neck tumors, who may struggle with feeding and experience weight loss.\n\nDesnutrición is also a significant issue in critical care settings, affecting patients with high metabolic and catabolic demands, such as burn victims. The condition can worsen the prognosis of patients by exacerbating the effects of drug-nutrient interactions and complicating existing health issues. \n\nThe Government of Spain recognizes malnutrition as a significant health concern and is actively working to address it through specific strategies and regulations. Overall, desnutrición is a complex condition that requires careful assessment and intervention to improve patient outcomes across various demographics and medical conditions.\",25\r\n168,IMC,\"The IMC, or Índice de Masa Corporal (Body Mass Index), is a crucial measure used to assess body weight in relation to height, serving as an important tool for evaluating nutritional status in various patient populations. It is particularly significant in calculating energy needs in children and is utilized to classify individuals based on their weight relative to their height, which is essential for assessing obesity risk, especially in the context of diabetes.\n\nIn clinical settings, the IMC is employed to evaluate the nutritional status of patients prior to surgery, particularly in those with cancer, and is also studied in relation to the survival rates of patients undergoing esophagectomy. Furthermore, the IMC is a critical indicator for assessing the risk of mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (EPOC), where a BMI lower than 21 kg/m² is associated with an increased risk.\n\nFor instance, a specific case noted an IMC of 25.1 kg/m², highlighting its application in individual assessments. Overall, the IMC serves as a vital parameter in both clinical and nutritional evaluations, aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care.\",10\r\n2122,BRONCOASPIRACIÓN,\"BRONCOASPIRACIÓN refers to a medical condition characterized by the inhalation of food, liquid, or other materials into the lungs. This condition poses a significant risk for patients with dysphagia, particularly following a stroke, as it can lead to pneumonia. Additionally, broncoaspiración is associated with enteral nutrition, where the risk of inhalation of digestive contents into the respiratory tract is heightened. It is particularly relevant for patients who may require nasoenteral tubes, as this method of feeding can increase the likelihood of aspiration. Overall, broncoaspiración is a critical concern in medical settings, especially for vulnerable populations.\",5\r\n54,DISFAGIA,\"Disfagia, also known as dysphagia, is a medical condition characterized by difficulty in swallowing. It is often associated with various health issues, particularly head and neck tumors, neurological disorders, and esophageal cancer. This condition can lead to significant nutritional risks, including malnutrition and aspiration, which can complicate the health of affected individuals. \n\nPatients with disfagia may require dietary modifications and specialized nutritional products to ensure adequate feeding. In some cases, enteral nutrition support may be necessary to meet their nutritional needs. The condition is particularly prevalent among patients with conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and those suffering from cerebrovascular diseases, where swallowing difficulties can exacerbate nutritional deficiencies.\n\nDisfagia is a cardinal symptom of esophageal cancer, often not presenting in the early stages of the disease, and it contributes to weight loss and alterations in food intake.
