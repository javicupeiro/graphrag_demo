Si no consiguen alcanzar o mantener los objetivos nutricionales previstos con las modificaciones de la dieta, se pueden adicionar suplementos artificiales. Los preparados más empleados suelen ser poliméricos e hipercalóricos. En pacientes con EPOC y BQ desnutridos, se suelen recomendar una serie de modificaciones en la dieta con el objetivo de mantener o mejorar la ingesta calórica; si no es posible con estas medidas, los suplementos orales han demostrado mejorar el estado nutricional, la composición corporal, la funcionalidad y la calidad de vida. En caso de requerir soporte nutricional artificial parece más importante estimar los requerimientos calóricos de forma ajustada (para evitar una producción excesiva de dióxido de carbono), que el tipo de fórmula a emplear (con alto contenido en hidratos de carbono o grasas). En ambos grupos de pacientes las indicaciones de soporte nutricional enteral por sonda o parenteral son similares a las empleadas en otras patologías.\n\nEl control dietético y nutricional debe incluirse en un programa multidisciplinar de rehabilitación respiratoria que permita mejorar la capacidad funcional, la calidad de vida y reducir, al menos teóricamente, la morbimortalidad asociada a la desnutrición en estos pacientes.\n\n## 10.
