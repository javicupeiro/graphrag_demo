La rehabilitación de la DOF es una disciplina de desarrollo aún reciente. Para avanzar, necesitamos conocer mejor la fisiopatología de la deglución, sobre todo los aspectos cuantitativos y cómo influyen en ella las medidas terapéuticas. Así mismo, se necesitan estudios bien diseñados y con mayor número de pacientes que permitan establecer qué tratamientos son los más eficaces en los distintos subgrupos clínicos. La colaboración multidisciplinar, que debe incluir siempre al paciente y cuidadores, sigue y seguirá siendo imprescindible.\n\n## 6. BIBLIOGRAFÍA\n\n1. Langmore SE, Pisegna JM.
