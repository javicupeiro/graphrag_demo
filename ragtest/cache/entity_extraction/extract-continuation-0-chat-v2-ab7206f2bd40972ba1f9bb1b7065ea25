Introducci√≥n y epidemiolog√≠a\n\nLa obesidad es una de las enfermedades metab√≥licas m√°s prevalentes, y se asocia a numerosas complicaciones m√©dicas, psicosociales y a un evidente deterioro en la calidad de vida¬π. La obesidad condiciona un aumento de la mortalidad global y da lugar a numerosas enfermedades, como son la diabetes mellitus (DM) tipo 2, el s√≠ndrome de apnea obstructiva del sue√±o, enfermedades articulares, digestivas, endocrinol√≥gicas, neoplasias etc.¬≤.\n\nLa obesidad es una enfermedad altamente prevalente. Los pa√≠ses con prevalencia m√°s elevada de obesidad, superior al 30%, son EE UU (aproximadamente el 34%), M√©jico y Arabia Saud√≠. En Europa, las tasas m√°s elevadas corresponden a Reino Unido, Alemania, Bulgaria y Espa√±a.\n\nEn Espa√±a, la prevalencia de obesidad ha aumentado en los √∫ltimos a√±os, especialmente las formas m√°s graves (IMC > 40 kg/m¬≤). Los estudios m√°s recientes (ENRICA¬≥, Di@bet.es‚Å¥ y ENPE‚Åµ) muestran una prevalencia de obesidad entre el 21,6-28,2 y de sobrepeso entre 39,3-51. La mayor√≠a de estos estudios han encontrado un incremento de la prevalencia de la obesidad con la edad, con valor m√°ximo en torno a los 60 a√±os.
