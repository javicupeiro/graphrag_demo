Cuando por cualquier causa no puede administrarse es posible sustituirla por fórmulas para lactantes cuya composición nutricional cada vez es más parecida a la de la leche materna, aunque nunca llegará a igualarla (ya que esta contiene además hormonas, factores inmunológicos, enzimas y células viables). La base para su fabricación suele ser la leche de vaca.
