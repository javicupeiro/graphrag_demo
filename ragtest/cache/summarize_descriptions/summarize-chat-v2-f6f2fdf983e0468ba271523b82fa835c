{"result": "MUTACIONES refer to genetic alterations that can have significant implications for human health. Notably, mutations in the PAH gene are associated with various forms of phenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder that can result from over 400 identified mutations. Additionally, mutations in the X-ALD gene are responsible for adrenoleukodystrophy, a condition characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in the body. These mutations highlight the diverse effects that genetic changes can have on metabolic processes and overall health.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
