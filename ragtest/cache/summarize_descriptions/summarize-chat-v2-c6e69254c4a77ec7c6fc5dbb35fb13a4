{"result": "Gastrostomy is a medical procedure that involves creating an opening in the stomach for various purposes, including the placement of a SNG (Sonda Nasogástrica) for nutritional support. The SNG is also utilized to insufflate air into the stomach prior to performing a gastrostomy, which helps prepare the stomach for the procedure. Thus, both gastrostomy and SNG are interconnected in the context of providing nutritional support and facilitating the surgical process.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
