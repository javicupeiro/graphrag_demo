{"result": "INMUNONUTRICIÓN is a specialized nutritional approach that focuses on the study and application of nutrition to influence the immune response, particularly in patients who require artificial nutritional support or are undergoing surgery. This approach is particularly beneficial for patients with underlying health conditions, as it aims to reduce postoperative infections and improve recovery, especially in those undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. Inmunonutrición also addresses the hypermetabolic response to surgery, helping to enhance postoperative recovery by incorporating specific nutrients that support the immune system and mitigate metabolic stress in patients.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
