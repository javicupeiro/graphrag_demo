{"result": "EDAD, which translates to \"age\" in English, is a significant demographic factor that plays a crucial role in determining nutritional needs and risks, particularly among different patient populations. It serves as a key predictor for the necessity of enteral nutrition via tube in patients undergoing surgery, highlighting its importance in clinical settings. Additionally, EDAD encompasses various age groups that are specified in dietary recommendations for macronutrients and vitamins, indicating its relevance in nutritional guidelines. Furthermore, in pediatric patients, age is a determining factor in calculating nutritional requirements and the volume of enteral nutrition needed, underscoring the critical influence of age across different stages of life on nutritional care.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
