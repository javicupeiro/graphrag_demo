{"result": "NUTRICIÃ“N PARENTERAL and COSTE-EFECTIVIDAD are closely related concepts in the context of nutritional support. Cost-effectiveness plays a crucial role in determining the use of parenteral nutrition, particularly due to its significant economic implications. Parenteral nutrition is typically more expensive than enteral nutrition, which directly affects its cost-effectiveness. Therefore, when considering nutritional options, the higher costs associated with parenteral nutrition must be weighed against its benefits to assess its overall value in patient care.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
