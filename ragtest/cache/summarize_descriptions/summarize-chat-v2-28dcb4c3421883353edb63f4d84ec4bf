{"result": "SELENIO, or selenium, is a trace mineral that plays a critical role in various bodily functions, including reproduction, thyroid function, DNA synthesis, immune function, and thyroid hormone metabolism. It is recognized for its antioxidant properties and is important for overall metabolism. While selenium supplementation is not sufficiently supported by evidence for recommendation in oncological patients, it is advised to be administered intravenously in the care of burn patients. Additionally, there are specific dietary recommendations for daily intake of selenium, and it may be necessary to increase selenium intake for patients undergoing prolonged dialysis.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
