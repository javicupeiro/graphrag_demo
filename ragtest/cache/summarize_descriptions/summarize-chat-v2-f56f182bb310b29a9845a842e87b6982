{"result": "TRAUMATISMOS refer to physical injuries that can significantly impact an individual's health and nutritional needs. These injuries may lead to increased nutritional requirements, potentially necessitating enteral nutrition to support recovery. In some cases, they can also affect the intestines, resulting in complications that might require parenteral nutrition. Additionally, TRAUMATISMOS may require medical and nutritional attention, particularly in the context of immunomodulatory formulas. Surgical interventions, such as faringostomía, may also be necessary in the management of these injuries. Overall, TRAUMATISMOS encompass a range of injuries that demand careful medical and nutritional consideration to ensure optimal recovery.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
