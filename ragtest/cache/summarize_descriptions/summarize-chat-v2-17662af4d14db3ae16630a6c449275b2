{"result": "Deglución, also known as deglutition, refers to the act of swallowing. This process is a key focus in various assessment methods related to swallowing. The act of deglución can be influenced by the viscosity of liquids, which can be modified by the use of espesantes (thickeners). Understanding these factors is essential for evaluating and managing swallowing difficulties.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
