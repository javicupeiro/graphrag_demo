These products are often utilized in various medical contexts, such as for patients with cancer, cystic fibrosis, or those suffering from malnutrition. They aim to enhance dietary intake and support recovery, especially in oncology patients who may be at risk of malnutrition. While some supplements are marketed with claims of health benefits, such as promoting \"eternal youth,\" their effectiveness can be questionable.
