{"result": "MÚSCULO refers to the muscle tissue in the body, which plays a crucial role in various physiological functions. It contains approximately 20% of the total magnesium in the body and is instrumental in regulating magnesium levels. Muscle tissue is developed through protein synthesis and is significantly influenced by factors such as exercise and protein intake. Additionally, during physical activity, muscle tissue requires energy derived from fats and carbohydrates to perform optimally.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
