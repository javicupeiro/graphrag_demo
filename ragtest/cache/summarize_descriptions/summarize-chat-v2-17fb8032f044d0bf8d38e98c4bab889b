{"result": "CITOQUINAS, also known as cytokines, are signaling molecules that play a crucial role in the immune response. They are proteins that influence inflammation and immune responses, making them significant in various medical contexts, including cancer and nutritional support. Citoquinas are particularly important in the context of immunonutrition, where their effects on the immune system are studied to enhance health outcomes. Additionally, inflammatory cytokines released during conditions such as sepsis can impact liver function and contribute to hepatobiliary complications. Overall, CITOQUINAS are essential proteins in cell signaling, especially regarding immune responses and inflammation.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
