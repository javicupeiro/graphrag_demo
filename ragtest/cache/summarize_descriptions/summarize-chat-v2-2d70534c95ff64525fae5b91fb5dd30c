{"result": "S√çNDROME DE ALERGIA ORAL, also known as oral allergy syndrome, is a condition characterized by allergic reactions triggered by certain fruits and vegetables in individuals who have pollen allergies. This syndrome occurs due to the presence of plant proteins that cross-react with airborne allergens, resulting in symptoms such as itching and swelling in the mouth and throat. The reactions primarily affect the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, highlighting the connection between specific food items and pollen sensitivities.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
