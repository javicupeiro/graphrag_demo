{"result": "Enzimas pancreáticas, or pancreatic enzymes, are digestive enzymes that play a crucial role in aiding digestion, particularly for individuals with malabsorption issues. These enzymes are often supplemented in patients suffering from conditions such as EPOC (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and bronquiectasias, where nutrient absorption is compromised. They are especially beneficial for cystic fibrosis patients, as these individuals frequently experience difficulties in digesting fats and absorbing essential nutrients. By providing these supplements, pancreatic enzymes help improve overall nutrient absorption and support digestive health in affected patients.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
