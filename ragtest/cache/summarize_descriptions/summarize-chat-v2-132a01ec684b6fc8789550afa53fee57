It plays a crucial role in developing and implementing health guidelines and standards that influence global health practices. The OMS has established international reference patterns for child growth and has developed tools for nutritional assessment, including guidelines for rehydration solutions and nutritional support for patients with intestinal failure.\n\nIn addition to its focus on child health, the OMS provides comprehensive guidelines for diagnosing diabetes mellitus based on blood glucose levels and has established classifications for neuroendocrine tumors. The organization also addresses obesity treatment and management, offering recommendations and guidelines to improve health outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, the OMS provides valuable resources such as food composition databases and guidelines for calculating energy requirements across various populations. It leads global health initiatives and shapes the health research agenda, ensuring that health policies are informed by evidence and best practices. Through its extensive work, the OMS significantly influences nutritional evaluations and health assessments for children and adolescents, promoting better health standards worldwide.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
