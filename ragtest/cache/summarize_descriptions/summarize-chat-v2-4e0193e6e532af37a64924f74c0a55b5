{"result": "NUTRICIÃ“N ENTERAL refers to the process of delivering essential nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract through feeding tubes. These feeding tubes, known as SONDA ENTERAL, play a critical role in the administration of enteral nutrition. They are vital for ensuring that patients receive the necessary nutrients, especially when they are unable to consume food orally. Additionally, the enteral tube significantly influences drug interactions and nutrient absorption, highlighting its importance in both nutritional support and medication management.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
