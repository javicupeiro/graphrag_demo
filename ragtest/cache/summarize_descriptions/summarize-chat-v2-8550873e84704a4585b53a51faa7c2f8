This program focuses on managing the nutritional needs of these patients to maintain their weight and enhance their quality of life during treatment. NED has been studied in relation to the quality of life of patients, indicating its significance in improving health outcomes. Additionally, NED is also a subject of epidemiological surveys conducted across various countries, highlighting its relevance in the broader context of nutritional therapy.
