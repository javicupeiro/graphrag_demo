{"result": "LACTOSA is a disaccharide sugar found in milk, known for its potential to cause intolerance in certain individuals, particularly adults who may have difficulty absorbing it. This condition, known as lactose intolerance, can lead to various gastrointestinal symptoms following the consumption of lactose-containing products. While lactosa is present in many dairy products, it is also found in some pediatric formulas, although some of these formulas are clinically labeled as lactose-free due to their very low lactose content.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
