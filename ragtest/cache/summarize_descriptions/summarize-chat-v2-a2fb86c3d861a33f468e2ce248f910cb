{"result": "NUTRICIÓN ENTERAL refers to a specific approach to nutrition that is essential for patients who are unable to consume food orally. This method involves providing nutrition directly to the gastrointestinal tract, making it a critical option when oral intake is not feasible. Enteral nutrition is particularly important in the management of patients with neurological diseases, where traditional feeding methods may not be applicable.\n\nOn the broader spectrum, NUTRICIÓN encompasses various methods of providing nutrients, including both enteral and parenteral nutrition. While enteral nutrition is a specific technique within this broader category, nutritional support as a whole includes both approaches to ensure that patients receive the necessary nutrients for their health and recovery.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
