{"result": "NUTRICIÓN ENTERAL refers to the provision of nutrition through the gastrointestinal tract, typically used for patients who cannot consume food orally. One specific method of achieving this is through YEYUNOSTOMÍA, which is recommended for patients requiring enteral nutrition following an esophagectomy. This procedure balances the benefits and risks associated with enteral feeding. Yeyunostomy serves as an alternative method for providing enteral nutrition, particularly in cases where gastric access is not feasible. Overall, YEYUNOSTOMÍA is a crucial technique within the broader context of NUTRICIÓN ENTERAL, ensuring that patients receive necessary nutrients when traditional oral intake is not possible.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
