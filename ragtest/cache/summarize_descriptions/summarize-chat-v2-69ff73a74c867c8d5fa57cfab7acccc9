{"result": "The \"SONDA NASOGÁSTRICA\" refers to a nasogastric tube, which is a flexible medical device inserted through the nose into the stomach. This device is primarily used for enteral feeding, providing nutrition or medication to patients who are unable to ingest food orally. It serves as a method for short- to medium-term nutritional support, allowing for the administration of hyperosmolar diets and continuous or intermittent infusion flows.\n\nIn addition to its primary function of delivering nutrition, the nasogastric tube can also be utilized to assess a patient's tolerance to infusion and to check for significant reflux prior to medical interventions. Overall, the SONDA NASOGÁSTRICA is an essential tool in medical settings for managing patients with swallowing difficulties or other conditions that impair oral intake.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
