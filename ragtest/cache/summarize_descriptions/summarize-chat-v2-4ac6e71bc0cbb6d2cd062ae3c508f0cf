{"result": "Nutritional supplements are products designed to enhance dietary intake and support overall health. They are commonly utilized in various clinical settings, particularly for patients who are malnourished or have specific health conditions. For instance, these supplements are often recommended for cancer patients to improve nutritional intake and aid in recovery. Additionally, they play a crucial role in addressing deficiencies in children and are particularly important for individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery, as they help ensure adequate protein and nutrient intake post-surgery. Furthermore, specific dietary supplements may be prescribed to patients to stabilize weight and manage symptoms associated with conditions such as MNGIE (Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalomyopathy) and diabetes. Overall, nutritional supplements serve as a vital tool in enhancing diet and supporting health across various patient populations.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
