{"result": "Glutamina, also known as glutamine, is a non-essential amino acid that can become essential under certain stress conditions, particularly in medical scenarios involving metabolic stress. It plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes, serving as a vital energy source for enterocytes and intestinal cells, and is important for immune cell function. \n\nResearch has shown that glutamina can be beneficial in several clinical situations, especially for patients undergoing autologous transplants, as it has been studied in relation to long-term mortality in these individuals. It is also recognized for its potential to prevent nutritional problems in oncology patients, particularly those suffering from mucositis, where it may help reduce pain and difficulty in eating, although it does not affect the incidence or severity of mucositis when administered intravenously.\n\nIn critically ill patients, especially those with severe burns or post-surgical conditions, glutamina is considered conditionally essential and may be supplemented in nutritional therapy to improve outcomes. It has been associated with improved postoperative complication rates when included in nutritional support. Additionally, glutamina has shown promise in protecting digestive function during treatments like chemotherapy and has been suggested to alleviate symptoms of hepatic veno-occlusive disease in transplant patients.\n\nDespite its benefits, glutamina is not included in standard parenteral nutrition solutions due to its instability, but it can be administered through other means. Its increasing interest in pediatric care highlights its potential advantages across different patient populations. Overall, glutamina is recognized for its multifaceted role in health and recovery, particularly in stressful medical conditions.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
