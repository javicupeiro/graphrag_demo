{"result": "NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL and NUTRICIÓN ARTIFICIAL are closely related concepts in the field of nutritional support. NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL refers to a method of providing nutritional support directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. This approach is categorized under NUTRICIÓN ARTIFICIAL, which encompasses various methods of delivering nutrition when traditional dietary intake is inadequate. Specifically, parenteral nutrition is utilized when enteral nutrition, which involves feeding through the gastrointestinal tract, is insufficient to meet a patient's nutritional needs. Thus, both NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL and NUTRICIÓN ARTIFICIAL play crucial roles in ensuring adequate nutrition for individuals who cannot obtain sufficient nourishment through normal eating.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
