{"result": "NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL, or parenteral nutrition, is a medical intervention used to provide essential nutrients to patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrition through oral intake. However, it carries the risk of developing Síndrome de Realimentación, or refeeding syndrome, particularly in patients who are malnourished. This syndrome is a serious complication that can arise when transitioning patients back to nutrition after a period of starvation or inadequate intake. It is crucial to manage parenteral nutrition carefully to mitigate the risk of refeeding syndrome, as improper administration can lead to significant health issues in vulnerable patients. Therefore, healthcare providers must be vigilant when initiating feeding in patients who have been on nutrición parenteral to prevent this potential complication.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
