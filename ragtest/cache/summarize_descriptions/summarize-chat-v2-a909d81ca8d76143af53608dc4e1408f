It defines hygiene standards for food and recommends daily intake levels of essential nutrients such as DHA and EPA, as well as iron supplements to prevent maternal anemia during childbirth.\n\nIn addition to these nutritional guidelines, the OMS is involved in promoting healthy and sustainable diets and has provided recommendations on dietary sugar intake. The organization has also contributed to the clinical understanding of health conditions, such as osteoporosis, by establishing a definition based on bone mineral density measurements in 1994. Overall, the OMS is committed to improving global health standards and ensuring the well-being of populations worldwide.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
