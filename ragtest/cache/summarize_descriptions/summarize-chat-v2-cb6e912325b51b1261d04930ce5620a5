{"result": "ENFERMEDADES CARDIOVASCULARES refer to a range of health conditions that primarily affect the heart and blood vessels. These diseases are notably prevalent among individuals with diabetes, leading to increased mortality rates in this population. Additionally, ENFERMEDADES CARDIOVASCULARES may require specific dietary considerations, such as low electrolyte formulas for infants, to manage health effectively. Furthermore, these cardiovascular diseases are a significant area of research within the RETICS (Redes Tem치ticas de Investigaci칩n Cooperativa en Salud), which focuses on improving cardiovascular health outcomes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
