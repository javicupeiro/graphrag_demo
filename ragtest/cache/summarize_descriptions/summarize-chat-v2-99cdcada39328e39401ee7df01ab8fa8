{"result": "CALORIMETRÍA INDIRECTA is a method used to measure energy expenditure in patients, making it particularly useful for assessing the nutritional needs of critically ill children. This technique is important for calculating nutritional requirements and is the preferred method for determining the energy expenditure at rest in oncological patients. Overall, CALORIMETRÍA INDIRECTA serves as a vital tool in understanding and addressing the energy needs of critically ill individuals.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
