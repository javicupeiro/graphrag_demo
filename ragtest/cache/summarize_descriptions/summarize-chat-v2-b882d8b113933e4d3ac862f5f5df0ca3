{"result": "Fibrosis Quística, also known as Cystic Fibrosis, is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. This condition is characterized by the production of thick mucus, which can lead to severe respiratory issues and complications, including frequent lung infections. Additionally, it poses significant nutritional challenges, often resulting in malnutrition due to difficulties in digestion and absorption of nutrients.\n\nIndividuals with Fibrosis Quística require specific nutritional support and enzyme supplementation to aid in proper digestion. The management of this disorder involves a comprehensive approach that includes dietary adjustments and medical interventions to address both respiratory and nutritional needs. Overall, Fibrosis Quística is a complex genetic condition that necessitates ongoing care and support to mitigate its impact on health and quality of life.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
