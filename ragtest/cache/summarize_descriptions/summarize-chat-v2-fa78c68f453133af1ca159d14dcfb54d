{"result": "YEYUNOSTOMÍA is a surgical procedure that involves the creation of an opening in the jejunum, primarily for the purpose of enteral nutrition. This procedure is typically indicated for patients whose stomach is not functional, such as those who have undergone esophagectomy or total gastrectomy, or in cases of tumor invasion. The procedure allows for the placement of a feeding tube directly into the jejunum, facilitating artificial feeding when other methods, like gastrostomy, are not feasible. It is also utilized in specific medical conditions, such as Glycogen Storage Disease Type III (GSDIII), where enteral feeding is necessary. Overall, YEYUNOSTOMÍA serves as a critical intervention for patients requiring nutritional support through the jejunum.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
