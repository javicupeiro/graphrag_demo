{"result": "PREDYCES is a comprehensive study conducted in hospitals aimed at assessing the prevalence of malnutrition among oncology patients. This research group, known as PREDyCES, has focused on the prevalence and associated costs of malnutrition in hospitalized patients. In one of its significant findings, the study included 352 patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, highlighting alarmingly high rates of malnutrition both upon admission and at discharge. Through these efforts, PREDYCES seeks to shed light on the critical issue of malnutrition in the healthcare setting, particularly among vulnerable patient populations.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
