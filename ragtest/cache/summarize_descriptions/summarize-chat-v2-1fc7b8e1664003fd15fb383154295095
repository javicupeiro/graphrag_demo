{"result": "Fenitoína is a medication that is often implicated in drug-nutrient interactions, particularly in sensitive populations. It requires careful monitoring when administered through enteral feeding due to its narrow therapeutic range. To enhance absorption, Fenitoína should be taken on an empty stomach.
