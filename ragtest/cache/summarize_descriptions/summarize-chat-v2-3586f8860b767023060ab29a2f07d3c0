{"result": "Bronchiectasis, or \"bronquiectasias,\" is a medical condition characterized by the abnormal and permanent dilation of the bronchi, which results from chronic inflammation of the bronchial walls. This condition often leads to chronic respiratory issues and can be a complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (EPOC). The persistent dilation of the bronchi causes alterations in pulmonary function, contributing to ongoing respiratory difficulties. Overall, bronchiectasis is marked by significant changes in the airways, which can severely impact an individual's respiratory health.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
