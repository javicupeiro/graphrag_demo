{"result": "LITERA refers to a type of covered litter or carriage that is associated with journeys and adventures. In the context of Don Quijote, the litera is depicted as a funeral litter, specifically transporting the remains of a deceased knight from Baeza to Segovia. Don Quijote, in his delusions, believes that the litera may contain a wounded or dead knight, highlighting his romanticized view of chivalry and adventure.
