{"result": "\"INTOLERANCIAS ALIMENTARIAS\" refers to food intolerances, which are adverse reactions to certain foods that do not involve the immune system. These conditions often arise from enzyme deficiencies, making it difficult for individuals to digest specific foods. Common examples include lactose and fructose intolerance. The symptoms associated with food intolerances primarily affect the gastrointestinal system, leading to various health issues. These reactions are characterized as non-immune responses, specifically not mediated by IgE, and can result in a range of gastrointestinal symptoms and other health problems. Overall, food intolerances represent a significant concern for those affected, impacting their dietary choices and overall well-being.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
