It is also utilized in the management of hyponatremia and can help reduce fluid retention in patients with hypertension and edema. The bioavailability of furosemida can be influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract; therefore, it is recommended that the medication be taken on an empty stomach to enhance absorption.
