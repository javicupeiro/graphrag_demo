{"result": "Peña Pobre is a significant geographical location that appears in the context of literary reflections, particularly in relation to Don Quijote and the legendary knight Amadís. It is depicted as a remote and secluded place where Don Quijote contemplates his past trials and tribulations, embodying his delusional state as he imagines himself under enchantment. This location serves as a retreat for Don Quijote, symbolizing his desire to emulate the knights of old and engage in penance, much like Amadís, who is also said to have performed penance there. Additionally, Peña Pobre is portrayed as a site of sorrow for Amadís, who retreated to mourn his unrequited love for Oriana.
