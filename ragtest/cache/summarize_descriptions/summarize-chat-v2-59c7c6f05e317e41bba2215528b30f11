{"result": "ICTUS refers to a medical condition commonly known as a stroke, which is a significant health issue in Spain, particularly affecting the elderly population. It is characterized by the need for specific screening and treatment for oropharyngeal dysphagia, a condition that can arise in patients following a stroke.
