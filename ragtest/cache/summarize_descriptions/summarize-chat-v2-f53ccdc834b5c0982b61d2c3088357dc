{"result": "COSTE-EFECTIVIDAD refers to the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of nutritional interventions within the healthcare sector. This concept involves an economic evaluation that compares the costs and benefits of different nutritional methods, particularly focusing on enteral versus parenteral nutrition. The analysis of cost-effectiveness is essential for determining the economic viability of home artificial nutrition in comparison to other treatment options. By utilizing cost-effectiveness analysis, healthcare professionals can evaluate various interventions aimed at achieving specific health outcomes, thereby making informed decisions that optimize resource allocation. Notably, enteral nutrition is often highlighted for its lower associated costs compared to parenteral nutrition, making it a more economically favorable option in many cases.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
