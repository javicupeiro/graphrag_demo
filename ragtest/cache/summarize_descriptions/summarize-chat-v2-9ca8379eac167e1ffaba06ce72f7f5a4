{"result": "Obstrucción refers to a common complication that can occur in patients using nasogastric tubes. This issue is often associated with factors such as the density and fiber content of the formula being administered. Additionally, obstrucción can arise from the accumulation of secretions or malfunctioning of the tube itself. Thus, it is important to monitor and manage these factors to prevent complications related to nasogastric tube use.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
