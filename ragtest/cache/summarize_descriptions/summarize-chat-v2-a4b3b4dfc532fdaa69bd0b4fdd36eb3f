{"result": "NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL and SÍNDROME DE INTESTINO CORTO are closely related in the context of nutritional support for patients with reduced intestinal absorption. The síndrome de intestino corto, or short bowel syndrome, often necessitates the use of nutrición parenteral to ensure adequate nutrient intake due to the significant decrease in the absorptive capacity of the intestines. This condition is characterized by a severely shortened intestinal length, which can lead to malnutrition and other complications if not properly managed. \n\nIn severe cases of short bowel syndrome, nutrición parenteral is considered an absolute indication for intervention, as it provides essential nutrients directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the compromised digestive system. Patients suffering from this syndrome frequently rely on parenteral nutrition to maintain their nutritional status and meet their dietary needs effectively. Overall, the relationship between NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL and SÍNDROME DE INTESTINO CORTO highlights the critical role of specialized nutritional support in managing the challenges posed by this condition.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
