{"result": "\"NUTRICIÓN ARTIFICIAL\" refers to the medical practice of providing nutrients to patients who are unable to eat by mouth, utilizing methods such as enteral and parenteral nutrition. This approach is often employed in clinical settings for individuals with various medical conditions, including those with severe swallowing difficulties, advanced cancer, or metabolic disorders. \n\nArtificial nutrition can be crucial for correcting nutritional deficiencies, such as in patients with celiac disease prior to initiating a gluten-free diet. It is also indicated for patients with reduced oral intake due to severe injuries, burns, or other critical health issues. However, the use of artificial nutrition may be associated with complications, such as fluid balance disturbances and conditions like SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion), which can lead to euvolemic hyponatremia.\n\nThe effectiveness and ethical considerations of artificial nutrition, particularly at the end of life, are subjects of ongoing debate. Overall, \"NUTRICIÓN ARTIFICIAL\" encompasses a range of nutritional support strategies aimed at ensuring that patients who cannot meet their dietary needs through conventional means receive adequate nourishment, whether in home care or hospital settings.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
