{"result": "NUTRICIÓN ENTERAL and NUTRICIÓN CLÍNICA are closely related concepts within the field of clinical nutrition. Enteral nutrition is a vital component of clinical nutrition, especially for patients who require nutritional support due to inadequate oral intake. It serves as a method of delivering nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract when oral consumption is insufficient to meet the patient's dietary needs. This approach is essential in ensuring that patients receive the necessary nutrition for recovery and overall health.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
