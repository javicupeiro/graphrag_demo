{"result": "NUTRICIÓN ENTERAL refers to enteral feeding techniques that are utilized to provide nutrition to patients who may have difficulty eating by mouth. These techniques can be particularly beneficial in managing uncontrollable vomiting (VÓMITOS INCOERCIBLES) in certain patients. However, it is important to note that uncontrollable vomiting can also serve as a contraindication for enteral nutrition, indicating that in some cases, the presence of this condition may prevent the safe implementation of enteral feeding methods. Therefore, while enteral nutrition can be a useful intervention for managing vomiting, careful consideration must be given to the patient's specific circumstances and health status.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
