{"result": "Aminoácidos are organic compounds that serve as the building blocks of proteins and are essential nutrients for various bodily functions. They play a crucial role in protein synthesis, recovery, and maintenance of lean body mass, particularly in specific patient populations. In burn patients, amino acids are vital for recovery, while in pediatric patients, they are essential for growth and development. Additionally, amino acids are supplied in parenteral nutrition formulations to help decrease protein catabolism in patients who are not experiencing severe metabolic stress. They are also important for individuals undergoing dialysis, highlighting their significance in supporting overall health and recovery in diverse medical contexts.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
