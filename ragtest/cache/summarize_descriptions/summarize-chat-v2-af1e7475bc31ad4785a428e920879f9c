{"result": "Almid贸n, commonly known as starch, is a carbohydrate that plays a significant role in various nutritional products, primarily serving as a source of energy. It is utilized in dietary products for energy provision and is also employed as a thickening agent in food products. Starch is particularly noted for its use in the preparation of espesantes, with modified corn starch being a common variant. Additionally, it is incorporated into clinical nutrition formulations to enhance viscosity and stability, making it a versatile ingredient in both culinary and nutritional applications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
