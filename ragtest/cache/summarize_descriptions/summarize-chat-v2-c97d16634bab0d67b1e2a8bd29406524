{"result": "NUTRICIÓN ARTIFICIAL refers to the provision of nutritional support through artificial means, primarily when the gastrointestinal tract is functional. One common method of delivering this support is through enteral nutrition (NE), which is preferred in cases where patients can still utilize their digestive system. However, patients who require nutrición artificial often face challenges such as neurological impairments that affect their ability to swallow, necessitating this intervention to ensure they receive adequate nutrition.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
