{"result": "NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL refers to the method of providing nutritional support intravenously, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. In the context of FÍSTULA PANCREÁTICA, which is an abnormal connection that forms between the pancreas and other structures, the effectiveness of nutritional support through parenteral means has been evaluated. It has been observed that parenteral nutrition is less effective in promoting the closure of pancreatic fistulas when compared to enteral nutrition. However, it may still play a role in the conservative management of pancreatic fistulas, suggesting that while it is not the preferred method for closure, it can be utilized as part of a broader management strategy.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
