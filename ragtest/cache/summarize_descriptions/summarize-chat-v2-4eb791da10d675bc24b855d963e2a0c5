{"result": "Clinoleic is a lipid emulsion that was introduced in the late 1990s, specifically designed for use in pediatric parenteral nutrition. It is formulated from a blend of 80% olive oil and 20% soybean oil, which results in a lower amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids and a higher concentration of oleic acid. This unique composition not only meets the nutritional needs of patients but also provides a high antioxidant effect, attributed to its vitamin E content.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
