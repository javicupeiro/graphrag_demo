{"result": "The term \"residuo gástrico\" refers to the volume of undigested food remaining in the stomach, particularly in patients receiving enteral nutrition. An increase in gastric residue is defined as a residual volume exceeding 200 ml. This elevated level can heighten the risk of complications such as regurgitation and bronchoaspiration. Monitoring gastric residue is crucial during enteral nutrition to ensure patient safety and effective nutritional delivery.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
