{"result": "NUTRICIÓN ENTERAL and GASTROSTOMÍA are closely related concepts in the context of providing nutritional support to patients. Gastrostomy is a medical procedure that serves as a method to deliver enteral nutrition for individuals requiring long-term nutritional assistance. This procedure is particularly important for patients who are unable to consume food orally, making it a vital option for those who cannot eat by mouth. In cases where enteral nutrition cannot be administered through oral means, gastrostomy becomes necessary, providing a direct access point for nutritional delivery. Overall, gastrostomy is utilized as a means to ensure that patients receive the essential nutrients they need when traditional eating methods are not feasible.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
