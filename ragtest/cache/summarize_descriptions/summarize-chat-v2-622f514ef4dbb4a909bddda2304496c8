{"result": "Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid that plays a critical role in various metabolic processes and is particularly significant in the context of nutritional support for patients experiencing critical illness and surgical recovery. It is often discussed in relation to its benefits for patients in catabolic states, such as those recovering from surgery, trauma, or severe illness. \n\nAs a dietary supplement, glutamine is administered to support the nutritional needs of critically ill patients, including those with brain injuries, burn injuries, and those undergoing chemotherapy or transplantation. It is frequently supplemented in both enteral and parenteral nutrition to enhance immune function, promote gut health, and aid in recovery while reducing complications and infections. \n\nResearch has shown that glutamine levels decrease during severe illness, highlighting its importance in clinical settings. Its use is particularly recommended for patients in critical care, where it has demonstrated benefits in improving recovery outcomes and minimizing complications. Overall, glutamine is a vital nutrient that supports the health and recovery of patients in various medical contexts.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
