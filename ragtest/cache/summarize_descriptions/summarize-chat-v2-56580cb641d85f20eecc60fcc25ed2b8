{"result": "Reflujo gastroesofágico, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a prevalent condition particularly noted in patients with cystic fibrosis. This condition is characterized by the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, which can result in symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion. In addition to these symptoms, reflujo gastroesofágico can lead to more serious complications, especially in individuals receiving enteral nutrition, where the risk of aspiration may increase.
