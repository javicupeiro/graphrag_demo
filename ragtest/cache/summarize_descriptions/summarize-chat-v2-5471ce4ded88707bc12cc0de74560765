{"result": "INFECCIÓN refers to the occurrence of infections that can arise from various medical conditions and interventions, particularly the use of catheters. It is a significant concern in patients with central venous catheters, where it can manifest as either local or systemic infections, leading to serious complications such as sepsis. Additionally, infections can occur in patients with compromised immune systems, including those who have undergone hematopoietic cell transplants, increasing their risk of severe health issues. Infections are also associated with dysphagia and malnutrition, which can further elevate morbidity in affected individuals. Overall, INFECCIÓN encompasses a range of complications that can severely impact patient health, particularly in vulnerable populations.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
