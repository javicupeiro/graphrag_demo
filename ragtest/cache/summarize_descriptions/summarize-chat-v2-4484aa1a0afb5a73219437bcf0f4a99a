{"result": "NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL PERIFÉRICA, commonly referred to as peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN), is a method of administering nutrients through a peripheral venous route. This approach is primarily utilized for patients who are unable to receive enteral feeding. PPN is designed for short-term nutritional support and is characterized by its limitations, particularly concerning the osmolarity of the nutrient solutions used. Due to these limitations, PPN does not offer the same benefits as central parenteral nutrition. Additionally, there are risks associated with this method, including complications such as thrombophlebitis. Overall, NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL PERIFÉRICA serves as a critical option for providing nutritional care in specific patient populations.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
