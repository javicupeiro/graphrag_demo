{"result": "Chronic kidney disease (enfermedad renal crónica) is a long-term medical condition that significantly impacts renal function and necessitates specialized nutritional care, particularly in its advanced stages. This condition can complicate venous access and elevate the risk of thrombosis. In managing chronic kidney disease, enteral formulas are often modified to restrict fluid intake and certain ions, ensuring that patients receive appropriate nutrition while minimizing potential complications associated with their condition.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
