{"result": "NUTRICIÃ“N ENTERAL refers to the practice of providing nutritional support through the gastrointestinal tract, typically in patients who are unable to meet their nutritional needs through oral intake. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) plays a significant role in this field by recommending guidelines for the initiation and management of enteral nutrition in patients with inadequate oral intake. ASPEN emphasizes that enteral nutrition should be the preferred method of nutritional support for patients who are able to tolerate it, highlighting its importance in clinical practice for ensuring adequate nutrition in vulnerable populations.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
