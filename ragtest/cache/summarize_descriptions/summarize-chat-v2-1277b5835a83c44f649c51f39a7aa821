{"result": "Dextrinomaltosa is a carbohydrate utilized in a variety of nutritional products, primarily for energy provision. It plays a significant role in enteral formulas, enhancing nutrient absorption while supplying energy. Additionally, dextrinomaltoase is specifically incorporated into pediatric formulas, where it serves as a source of energy and influences osmolarity depending on the length of its carbohydrate chains. Overall, dextrinomaltoase is valued for its functional properties in both general and specialized nutritional applications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
