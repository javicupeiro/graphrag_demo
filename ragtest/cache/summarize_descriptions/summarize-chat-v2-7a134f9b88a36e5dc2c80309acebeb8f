{"result": "CROMO, also known as chromium, is a trace mineral that plays a significant role in human nutrition. It is recognized as a nutrient for which upper limits have not been established, primarily due to insufficient data on potential adverse effects. Dietary recommendations exist for chromium, outlining specific daily intake levels that vary according to different age groups, as specified in dietary reference guidelines. However, it is important to note that chromium can be nefrotóxico (nephrotoxic) in neonates, indicating that it should be administered with caution in this vulnerable population. Overall, CROMO is essential for health, but its intake must be carefully managed, especially in certain demographics.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
