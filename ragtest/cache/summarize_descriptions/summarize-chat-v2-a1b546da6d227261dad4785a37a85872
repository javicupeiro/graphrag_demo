{"result": "Insuficiencia respiratoria, or respiratory failure, is a condition characterized by inadequate gas exchange in the lungs, leading to insufficient oxygen supply and/or carbon dioxide removal. Patients suffering from this condition often face challenges related to poor fluid management, necessitating the use of specific nutritional formulations to support their health. Additionally, respiratory failure can be associated with conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and may lead to complications like the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH), which further disrupts fluid and electrolyte balance in the body.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
