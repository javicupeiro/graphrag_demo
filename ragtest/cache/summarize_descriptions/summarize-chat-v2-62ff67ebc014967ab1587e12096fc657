{"result": "\"NUTRICIÓN ORAL\" refers to the intake of food and liquids through the mouth, which is the most common method of nutrition for hospitalized patients. This method is particularly preferred for patients with advanced gastric cancer when feasible, as it is beneficial for those recovering from gastric cancer surgery. Research indicates that oral nutrition is consistently safer and more effective than parenteral nutrition in terms of reducing postoperative complications. The process of oral nutrition may be adapted based on the individual's surgical recovery needs, ensuring that patients receive the necessary nutrients in a manner that supports their healing.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
