Adequate nutrition is fundamental for preventing malnutrition, which can lead to various adverse health effects. Malnutrition arises from inadequate nutrition and is particularly critical for patients with renal failure, highlighting the importance of proper dietary management in this population. Furthermore, malnutrition is a significant focus within the field of nutrition, necessitating thorough assessment and intervention strategies. In the context of cancer patients, nutrition plays a vital role in both preventing and managing malnutrition, ultimately influencing their overall health and the success of their treatment.
