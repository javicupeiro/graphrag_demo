{"result": "NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL refers to a medical treatment used for PACIENTES who are unable to receive nutrition through the gastrointestinal tract, commonly due to conditions that impair normal digestive function. This form of nutrition is essential for individuals with prolonged gastrointestinal dysfunction, as it provides the necessary nutrients directly into the bloodstream. In clinical studies, PACIENTES are often randomized to receive parenteral nutrition, highlighting its importance in managing their nutritional needs when enteral feeding is not feasible.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
