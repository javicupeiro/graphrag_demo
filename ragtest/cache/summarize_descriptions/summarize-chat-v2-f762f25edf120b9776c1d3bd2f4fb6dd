{"result": "The Turcos refer to the Turkish soldiers involved in military conflicts against Spanish forces in the region of Tunis. They are depicted as a group that instills fear among the Moros, characterized as insolent and domineering. The Turcos are also described as gallant individuals aboard a corsair ship, armed with firearms. Their actions have caused distress to Zoraida, leading to her father's concern and prompting the protagonist's involvement in the narrative. Additionally, the Turcos are portrayed as antagonists responsible for the deaths of two soldiers, for which they face punishment.
