{"result": "NUTRICIÓN ENTERAL is a medical intervention administered to PACIENTES to enhance their nutritional status, particularly in the post-operative phase. This form of nutrition is especially crucial for patients who have undergone esophagectomy, as they often face challenges in oral feeding due to their condition. Additionally, patients with esophageal cancer frequently require enteral nutrition to support their recovery after surgery. Enteral nutrition is also indicated for patients who are unable to feed orally due to various medical conditions. In clinical settings, patients may be assigned to receive enteral nutrition based on their specific health needs, and studies have involved randomizing patients to receive this nutritional support as part of their treatment protocol. Overall, enteral nutrition plays a vital role in the recovery and nutritional management of patients who cannot sustain adequate oral intake.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
