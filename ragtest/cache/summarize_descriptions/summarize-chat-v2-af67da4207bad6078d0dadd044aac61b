It encompasses the ceremonial act of Don Quijote preparing to be knighted, which he plans to undertake in the chapel of the castle. The term also signifies the weapons that Don Quijote carries, which are emblematic of his identity as a knight-errant and his commitment to the ideals of chivalry. \n\nAdditionally, the act of vigil over the arms is a significant ceremonial event that Don Quijote participates in prior to his knighthood, highlighting the importance of this ritual in his transformation. The armas symbolize not only his readiness for battle but also the burdens he must bear, as indicated by the phrase \"sangrientas y pesadas armas,\" which refers to the heavy and bloody arms of knights.
