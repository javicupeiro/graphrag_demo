{"result": "Nutritional supplementation involves providing additional nutrients to patients, either parenterally or enterally, to enhance their nutritional status and improve health outcomes. This practice is particularly beneficial for individuals with chronic conditions, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), where nutritional support can play a crucial role in managing health. Nutritional supplementation is also recommended to maintain nutritional balance during periods of prolonged dietary restrictions, such as before medical tests.
