{"result": "\"NUTRICIÓN ARTIFICIAL DOMICILIARIA\" refers to the provision of artificial nutrition at home, encompassing both enteral and parenteral nutrition for patients who are unable to meet their nutritional needs through regular food intake. This therapeutic modality is particularly significant for chronic patients, especially those with oncological conditions, as it allows for an improved nutritional status without the need for hospitalization. The NADYA group emphasizes the importance of home artificial nutrition (NAD) in their reports, highlighting its role in enhancing the quality of life for patients by enabling them to remain in their social and familial environments while receiving necessary nutritional support.\n\nHome artificial nutrition is designed to improve or maintain the nutritional status of patients who cannot consume adequate nutrition orally. It is a regulated medical treatment that requires specific guidelines for prescription and dispensing, ensuring that patients receive appropriate care tailored to their special dietary needs.
