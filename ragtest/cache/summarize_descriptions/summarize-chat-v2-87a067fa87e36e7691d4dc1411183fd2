{"result": "NUTRICIÓN PEDIÁTRICA, or pediatric nutrition, is a specialized field of medicine dedicated to addressing the dietary needs and nutritional health of infants, children, and adolescents. This discipline encompasses various aspects of nutrition, including the feeding and growth of children, with particular attention to those with health issues that necessitate specialized nutritional support. \n\nThe focus of NUTRICIÓN PEDIÁTRICA includes dietary recommendations for infants and young children, emphasizing the appropriate intake of macronutrients and micronutrients essential for their growth and development. It provides guidelines on the recommended intakes of vitamins, calcium, and iron, as well as the types and portions of food suitable for different age groups and activity levels.\n\nAdditionally, NUTRICIÓN PEDIÁTRICA addresses the nutritional requirements of children who are critically ill or have specific medical conditions, including those who require parenteral nutrition due to surgeries or other health challenges. The field also emphasizes enteral nutrition as the preferred method for delivering nutrients to children who cannot feed orally.\n\nOverall, NUTRICIÓN PEDIÁTRICA is crucial for ensuring that children receive the necessary nutritional support to promote their health and development, particularly during the formative years of infancy and childhood.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
