{"result": "Hydrolyzed formulas are specialized nutritional products designed primarily for infants and children with severe allergies to cow's milk proteins, as well as for those experiencing malabsorption issues. These formulas are formulated to provide essential nutrients in a predigested form, making them suitable for patients with severe digestive disorders. By breaking down proteins into smaller components, hydrolyzed formulas help reduce the risk of allergic reactions and facilitate easier digestion, thereby supporting the nutritional needs of vulnerable populations.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
