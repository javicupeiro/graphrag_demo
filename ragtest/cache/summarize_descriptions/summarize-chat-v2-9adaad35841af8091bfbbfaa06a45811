As a character, Guadiana is depicted as Durandarte's squire, who is part of a group enchanted by the wizard Merlín. This character is also associated with themes of sorrow, as referenced by Don Quijote, who laments the loss of beauty and joy connected to Guadiana. \n\nIn addition to its character representation, Guadiana is also the name of a river known for its hidden course. This river is notable in the narrative of Lope Ruiz, who attempts to cross it with his flock of goats. Furthermore, the river is said to have been transformed from the squire who mourned the loss of his companions, thus linking the character and the river in a poignant narrative of loss and transformation.
