{"result": "Glycogen Storage Disease Type III (GSDIII), also known as Cori disease, is a metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme amilo-1,6-glucosidase. This deficiency disrupts normal glycogen metabolism, resulting in a range of clinical manifestations. The disorder primarily affects glucose processing, leading to various complications, particularly involving muscular and hepatic systems. Individuals with GSDIII may experience a variety of symptoms related to these complications, highlighting the significant impact of this metabolic disorder on overall health.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
