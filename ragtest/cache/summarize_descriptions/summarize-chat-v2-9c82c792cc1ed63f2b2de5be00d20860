{"result": "NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL DOMICILIARIA, or home parenteral nutrition (NPD), is a specialized form of artificial nutrition that delivers essential nutrients directly into the bloodstream of patients who are unable to meet their nutritional needs through natural foods or who cannot receive necessary nutrients via the gastrointestinal tract. This treatment is particularly beneficial for patients with conditions such as inoperable intestinal obstruction and is designed to be administered in the comfort of the patient's home.\n\nNPD is primarily reserved for stable patients requiring prolonged nutritional support, focusing on enhancing their quality of life while also aiming to reduce overall treatment costs. It is applicable to both adult and pediatric patients, ensuring that individuals of all ages can receive the necessary nutritional care. The practice of home parenteral nutrition has been documented and studied by various groups, including the NADYA-SENPE group, which has contributed to the understanding of its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in healthcare settings.\n\nOverall, NUTRICIÓN PARENTERAL DOMICILIARIA represents a critical intervention for patients who depend on intravenous nutrition, allowing them to maintain a better quality of life while managing their health conditions at home.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
