{"result": "FAMILIARES, or family members of patients, play a crucial role in the healthcare process by providing essential support to the patient and participating in healthcare decisions. They are often consulted in situations where the patient is unable to give consent for treatment, ensuring that the patient's needs and preferences are considered. These family members are typically individuals who are close to the patient and can significantly influence decisions regarding the patient's treatment and consent, particularly in cases where the patient may be incapacitated. Their involvement is vital for ensuring that the patient's voice is heard and respected in the healthcare setting.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
