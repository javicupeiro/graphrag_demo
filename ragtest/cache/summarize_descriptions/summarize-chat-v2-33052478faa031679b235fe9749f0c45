{"result": "VENTILACIÓN MECÁNICA refers to a medical intervention that assists or replaces spontaneous breathing in patients, particularly in critical care settings. This form of respiratory support is especially relevant for premature newborns, as it can influence the administration of enteral nutrition. In cases where patients are unable to eat orally, mechanical ventilation often necessitates the use of enteral feeding to ensure they receive adequate nutrition. Thus, VENTILACIÓN MECÁNICA plays a crucial role not only in respiratory support but also in the nutritional management of patients who are critically ill or unable to feed themselves.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
