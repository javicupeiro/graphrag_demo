{"result": "NUTRICIÓN ENTERAL and ALIMENTACIÓN are interconnected concepts within the broader context of nutrition. Alimentación refers to the process of providing nourishment, which includes various methods of delivering nutrients. One specific method is nutrición enteral, which is particularly important for newborns, especially premature infants, who may require specialized nutritional support. Nutritional enteral is a method of providing alimentary support to patients who are unable to meet their nutritional needs through oral intake.
