{"result": "Obesidad, or obesity, is a medical condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat, typically measured by a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 30 kg/m². This condition has seen a significant increase in prevalence globally, rising from 105 million to 641 million individuals over the past four decades. It poses various health risks, including complications in children, where it complicates the calculation of nutritional requirements due to the absence of specific formulas for adjusted weight. \n\nIn patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (EPOC), obesity is associated with an increase in adipose tissue and a heightened risk of cardiovascular issues. Additionally, obesity can lead to decreased renal elimination of uric acid, raising the risk of hyperuricemia. It also complicates the treatment and nutritional support of critically ill patients. \n\nThe growing public health issue of obesity affects both developed and developing countries, prompting initiatives like the THAO-SALUD INFANTIL program, which aims to understand and prevent obesity through the promotion of healthy lifestyle habits. Furthermore, obesity is influenced by factors such as gut microbiota composition, highlighting its complex metabolic nature. Overall, obesity is a multifaceted condition that can lead to serious health complications and requires comprehensive strategies for prevention and management.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
