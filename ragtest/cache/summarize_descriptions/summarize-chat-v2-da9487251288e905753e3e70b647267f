{"result": "Guijarros are described as pebbles that serve a dual purpose in the context of conflict. On one hand, they are suggested to be used in bags for a playful fight, symbolizing a non-lethal approach to conflict. On the other hand, Guijarros also refers to the stones that were thrown during a chaotic event in the narrative, highlighting a more tumultuous aspect of their use.
