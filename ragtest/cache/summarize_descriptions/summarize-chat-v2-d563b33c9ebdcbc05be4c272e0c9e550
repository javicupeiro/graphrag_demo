{"result": "A systematic review is a research method that synthesizes the results of available studies on a specific topic to provide evidence-based conclusions. This approach is utilized in various fields, including nutrition and cognitive performance, where it aims to summarize existing research findings. For instance, a systematic review on parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis was conducted by Rangel SJ et al., demonstrating the application of this method in addressing specific health-related issues. Overall, systematic reviews serve as a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners by consolidating evidence and informing best practices.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
