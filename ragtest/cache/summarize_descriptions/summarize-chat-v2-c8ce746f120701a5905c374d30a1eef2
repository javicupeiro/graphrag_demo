{"result": "INFECCIONES refer to complications that are particularly significant in the context of surgical patients, especially those undergoing procedures related to cancer, such as gastric cancer surgery. These infections can manifest as wound infections or sepsis, posing serious health risks. In critical patients, infections are a major concern, prompting the exploration of various nutritional strategies aimed at reducing their incidence. Additionally, the use of central venous catheters is associated with a heightened risk of infections, which can lead to severe complications. Current research is focused on understanding the implications of immunomodulating formulas in the management of these infections among surgical patients.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
